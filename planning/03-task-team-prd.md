**Container Runtime**
- Podman da# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Containerized Task Implementation Team

## Executive Summary

This document defines a containerized task implementation system that creates a virtual development team using Claude Code agents to execute **a single, atomic development task**. Each team operates within an isolated container environment, decomposing the single task into internal subtasks (implementation, testing, review, etc.) executed by specialized sub-agents to ensure high quality output.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**Integration Computer**
- Dedicated host environment running Podman containers
- Manages resource allocation and container lifecycle
- Provides network isolation and security boundaries
- Monitors resource usage and enforces limits

**Working Tree Isolation**
- Each task gets a **simulated working tree** with only relevant files
- Pre-populated by orchestrator from feature branch (`task/{sprint-id}/{task-id}`)
- Contains isolated copy of files needed for this single atomic task
- **No direct repository access** - container operates on file copies only
- Physical and network isolation prevents access to actual project repository

**Container Runtime**
- Podman daemonless containers for maximum security isolation
- Claude Code running in **dangerous mode** within sandboxed environment
- **Simulated working tree** mounted as writable volume at `/workspace`
- **No network access** to external repositories or services
- **No file system access** beyond the isolated workspace

**Agent Orchestration Layer**
- Single Lead Claude Code agent manages the atomic task
- Sub-agents handle different aspects of the same task (code, tests, review, docs)
- Internal subtask decomposition within the single task scope
- All sub-agents work toward completing the one assigned task

## Operational Workflow

### Phase 1: Task Initialization
```
Orchestrator → Create feature branch task/{sprint-id}/{task-id}
Orchestrator → Extract relevant files for task into simulated environment
Orchestrator → Launch isolated container with file copies (no repo access)
Container → Initialize lead agent with task specification and isolated files
```

### Phase 2: Internal Task Decomposition and Execution
```
Lead Agent → Analyze the single task requirements
Lead Agent → Break task into internal development subtasks
Lead Agent → Spawn specialized sub-agents in parallel:
  ├── Implementation Agent (write the feature code)
  ├── Testing Agent (create tests for this feature)
  ├── Review Agent (review the implementation)
  ├── Refactoring Agent (optimize the implementation)
  ├── Documentation Agent (document this feature)
  └── Integration Agent (validate the complete implementation)
```

### Phase 3: Integration Preparation (Not Execution)
```
Lead Agent → Collect all sub-agent outputs for the single task
Lead Agent → Integrate implementation, tests, docs into cohesive solution
Integration Agent → Create integration tests and validate within sandbox
Lead Agent → Prepare integration instructions for orchestrator
Lead Agent → Generate RESULTS.md with task completion summary
Container → Signal single task completion to orchestrator
```

### Phase 4: Result Processing and Integration
```
Orchestrator → Collect RESULTS.md and task artifacts from sandbox
Orchestrator → Validate quality gates for this task
Orchestrator → Perform actual repository integration (container cannot do this)
Orchestrator → Execute integration tests in real environment
Orchestrator → Merge task branch or request rework
Orchestrator → Cleanup container and simulated environment
Orchestrator → Update dependency graph and trigger dependent tasks
```

- **Reserve Pool**: 10% held for integration and error handling

### Parallel Execution Context
- Each container executes exactly one atomic task
- Multiple containers run in parallel, each handling different tasks
- Dependency graph ensures tasks execute in correct order
- No coordination needed between containers (tasks are pre-decomposed)
- Resource scheduling based on task priority and dependencies

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Container Failure Scenarios
- **Out of Memory**: Automatic restart with increased limits
- **Timeout**: Partial result collection and manual review
- **Network Issues**: Retry with exponential backoff
- **Code Errors**: Sub-agent re-execution with modified prompts

### Quality Gate Failures
- **Test Failures**: Automatic debugging and retry cycle
- **Security Issues**: Immediate halt and manual review required
- **Coverage Issues**: Additional test generation cycle
- **Review Failures**: Refactoring cycle with updated requirements

## Monitoring and Observability

### Real-time Metrics
- Container resource utilization
- Token consumption rate
- Task progress indicators
- Quality gate status

### Logging and Audit Trail
- All agent interactions logged
- Code changes tracked with timestamps
- Decision rationale captured
- Performance metrics recorded

## Security Considerations

### Container Security (Critical - Dangerous Mode Isolation)
- **Complete Network Isolation**: No external network access whatsoever
- **Simulated Environment Only**: No access to actual repository or project files
- **Read-only Root Filesystem**: Container cannot modify system files
- **No Privileged Access**: Standard user permissions only
- **Resource Limits Enforced**: Memory, CPU, disk, and time boundaries
- **Dangerous Mode Contained**: Claude Code dangerous capabilities limited to sandbox

### Repository Security
- **Zero Repository Access**: Container never sees actual repository
- **File Copy Security**: Only specific files copied to simulated environment
- **Integration Separation**: All actual repository operations handled by orchestrator
- **Branch Isolation**: Task branches created and managed externally
- **Audit Trail**: All file access and modifications logged by orchestrator

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Dynamic Agent Spawning**: Create specialized agents based on task type
- **Cross-task Learning**: Share insights between implementation teams
- **Automated Optimization**: Self-tuning resource allocation
- **Quality Prediction**: ML-based success probability estimation

### Integration Points
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Issue tracking system hooks
- Code repository webhooks
- Notification and alerting systems

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative KPIs
- Task completion rate: >95%
- Quality gate pass rate: >90%
- Average implementation time: <30 minutes
- Resource utilization efficiency: >80%

### Qualitative Goals
- High code quality and maintainability

- Reduced technical debt accumulation

## Conclusion

This containerized task implementation team architecture provides a secure, isolated approach to executing individual atomic development tasks. By running Claude Code in dangerous mode within a completely sandboxed environment with no repository access, the system maximizes both AI capabilities and security. The task teams can operate with full autonomy on their isolated file copies while the parent orchestrator maintains complete control over actual repository integration, creating a robust security boundary between AI execution and production code.
