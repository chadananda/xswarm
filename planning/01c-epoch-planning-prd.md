# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Epoch Planning & AI-Optimized Task Decomposition

## Document: 01c-epoch-planning-prd.md

## Executive Summary

The Epoch Planning System transforms requirements and design specifications into AI-optimized development plans. Unlike human team planning (resource-constrained), this system optimizes for AI team characteristics: need for well-defined requirements, simple tasks with testable outcomes, and maximum parallelization. The system front-loads pure functions, maximizes code reuse, integrates content creation into development, and creates comprehensive sprint containers for isolated parallel execution.

**Key Differentiator**: Multi-pass planning process specifically designed for parallel AI development teams with integrated marketing and content creation.

## Planning Philosophy: Human vs AI Teams

### Human Team Constraints

- Limited developer resources
- Communication overhead
- Context switching costs
- Resource allocation conflicts

### AI Team Optimization

- Parallelization-constrained, not resource-constrained
- Require extremely well-defined, atomic tasks
- Excel with simple, testable units of work
- Need comprehensive mock environments and test data

## Multi-Pass Planning Process

### Pass 1: Pure Function Extraction

- Identify all data transformations, calculations, validations
- Create dependency graphs for function relationships
- Score functions by complexity and reusability potential
- Plan pure function library as Sprint 0 foundation

### Pass 2: Sprint-Specific Function Planning

- Extract reusable functions that depend on current development state
- Plan shared utilities for each sprint cluster
- Create function registry and documentation system
- Define function export and testing requirements

### Pass 3: Task Decomposition & Parallelization

- Break all functionality into atomic, testable tasks
- Map task dependencies and sprint organization
- Optimize for maximum parallel execution
- Define clear interfaces between all tasks

### Pass 4: Sprint Container Design

- Design isolated test environments for each sprint
- Plan mock data, services, and database states
- Create graduated complexity from simple to realistic
- Define integration testing and validation approaches

### Pass 5: Content & Marketing Integration

- Map features to documentation and marketing requirements
- Plan screenshot and video capture from testing
- Create content calendar integrated with development timeline
- Design promotional asset creation workflow

```

**Content Creation Workflow:**

- Screenshots from integration tests → How-to articles
- Video from E2E tests → Feature demonstrations
- Function documentation → Developer tutorials
- User journey validation → Experience articles

## Function Reuse System

### Function Registration Process

1. **Task Completion**: Task teams export all created functions
2. **Documentation**: Automated function signature and usage documentation
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit test suite for each function
4. **Registry Update**: Functions added to searchable registry
5. **Reuse Recommendations**: AI analysis of cross-task function opportunities

### Function Categories

- **Pure Functions**: No side effects, easily testable, highest reuse priority
- **Sprint-Specific Functions**: Depend on development state, moderate reuse
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions, logging, formatting, validation
- **Integration Functions**: API calls, database operations, service interactions

## Sprint Container Architecture

### Graduated Complexity Model

- **Sprint 1-2**: Simple mocks, static data, basic validation
- **Sprint 3-4**: Realistic data, service simulation, integration testing
- **Sprint 5+**: Full environment, live services, comprehensive E2E testing

### Container Isolation Strategy

- Each sprint runs in completely isolated environment
- Controlled dependencies and service availability
- Realistic but reproducible test data
- Automated setup and teardown procedures

## Marketing & Content Integration

### Feature Documentation Planning

- **User Stories**: Translated into how-to article outlines
- **Screenshots**: Captured during integration testing
- **Video Demos**: Recorded during E2E test execution
- **Developer Docs**: Generated from function documentation

### Promotional Calendar Integration

- **Sprint Completion**: Triggers content creation tasks
- **Feature Releases**: Coordinated with marketing calendar
- **Social Media**: Automated post generation from templates
- **Email Campaigns**: Feature announcement scheduling

### Content Asset Pipeline

```
Integration Test → Screenshots → How-to Articles → Social Posts → Email Content
E2E Test → Videos → Feature Demos → Blog Posts → Press Materials
Function Docs → Developer Tutorials → Community Content → Technical Articles
```
