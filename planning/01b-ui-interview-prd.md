# Product Requirements Document (PRD): UI/UX Interview & Interactive Prototyping System

## Document: 01b-ui-interview-prd.md

## Executive Summary

The UI/UX Interview System creates interactive prototypes for iterative design feedback during XSwarm epoch planning. The UX Designer AI builds standalone HTML demonstrations using Tailwind CSS, ShadCN components, and AlpineJS, hosted via GitHub Pages. The system generates consolidated iteration documents showing multiple design options with embedded commentary, creating a comprehensive visual record of the design process.

**Key Differentiator**: Stakeholders interact with functional prototypes, not static mockups.

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Design Concepts

- UX Designer creates 3 interactive prototypes exploring different approaches
- Generates single iteration document with embedded prototypes and commentary
- Posts to GitHub discussion with thumbnails and live link

### Phase 2: Iterative Refinement

- Collects stakeholder feedback from GitHub discussions
- Refines prototypes based on feedback patterns
- Creates new iterations until design consensus reached

### Phase 3: Design Specification

- Consolidates approved design into implementation specifications
- Documents design system and interaction patterns
- Prepares technical handoff package

## Technology & Hosting

**Frontend Stack**: HTML5 + Tailwind CSS + ShadCN + AlpineJS (all via CDN)
**Hosting**: GitHub Pages (free, permanent URLs)
**Thumbnails**: Automated generation for discussion previews
**Integration**: Native GitHub ecosystem

## Iteration Document Concept

Each iteration creates a single HTML page containing:

- **3 Interactive Options**: Embedded as iframes with full functionality
- **UX Commentary**: Designer rationale for each approach
- **Feedback Framework**: Structured questions to guide stakeholder input
- **Live GitHub Pages URL**: Shareable link for remote collaboration

**Example URL**: `username.github.io/project/.xswarm/epochs/epoch-2/planning/ui/iterations/iteration-3.html`

## Feedback & Quality Process

### Structured Feedback Collection

- Stakeholders interact with live prototypes
- Provide feedback via GitHub discussion comments
- UX Designer synthesizes patterns and conflicts
- Creates refined iterations based on consolidated input

### Quality Standards

- Fully functional interactive elements
- Responsive design across devices
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Fast loading performance (<3s)
- Realistic content and data

## Key Benefits

**For Stakeholders**: Test actual functionality, not guess from static images
**For Development**: Clear technical specifications with proven interactions
**For Documentation**: Complete visual evolution record with rationale
**For Collaboration**: Shareable URLs enable remote design reviews

## Integration Points

**Input**: Requirements from concept interview (`01a`) and expert consultations
**Output**: Design specifications and technical requirements for epoch planning (`01c`)
**Collaboration**: GitHub discussions with visual thumbnails and live demos

## Success Criteria

- Interactive prototypes that stakeholders can meaningfully evaluate
- 3-5 iterations maximum to reach design consensus
- Complete design specification ready for technical implementation
- Comprehensive visual record of design decisions and rationale
