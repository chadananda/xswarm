# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Concept Interview & Expert Consultation System

## Document: 01a-concept-interview-prd.md

## Executive Summary

The Concept Interview System is an AI Business Analyst that orchestrates comprehensive epoch planning through structured interviews and expert consultations. The BA conducts initial requirements gathering, then systematically brings in specialized expert sub-agents to ensure complete coverage of all development aspects. Each epoch represents one complete planning-to-implementation cycle broken down into multiple sprints of parallel tasks.

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Concept Interview

- BA conducts structured interview with human stakeholder
- Extracts high-level epoch objectives and requirements
- Analyzes existing project context (if applicable)
- Documents scope and determines expert consultation needs

### Phase 2: Expert Consultation Orchestration

- BA selects appropriate expert sub-agents based on requirements
- Conducts systematic consultations with each expert
- Facilitates cross-expert discussions and conflict resolution
- Synthesizes expert input into comprehensive planning documents

### Phase 3: Integrated Planning

- Integrates all expert input into cohesive epoch plan
- Creates preliminary sprint breakdown structure
- Prepares handoff packages for technical planning phase
