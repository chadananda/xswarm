🚀 **Website**: [xswarm.ai](https://xswarm.ai)
📦 **NPM Package**: [npmjs.com/package/xswarm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xswarm)
🐙 **GitHub**: [github.com/chadananda/xswarm](https://github.com/chadananda/xswarm)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Try it immediately with npx (no installation required)
npx xswarm

# Or install globally for repeated use
npm install -g xswarm
```

> ⚠️ **Current Status**: XSwarm CLI is in active development. Currently shows a placeholder while we build the full orchestration system. Full functionality coming Q2 2025.

## What is XSwarm?

XSwarm is an experiment in fixing the frustrations we all face with AI development. You know the drill: explain your codebase again, wait for sequential responses, deal with integration surprises, and somehow you're still the one doing all the glue work.

We wondered: what if we stop treating AI like a junior developer and instead design workflows around what AI is actually good at? Things like parallel execution, never forgetting context, and following precise specifications.

**The Problem**: One AI assistant → Sequential tasks → Constant context rebuilding → Integration surprises

**Our Approach**: Orchestrated AI teams → Parallel execution → Shared function libraries → Guaranteed integration

## How It Works: The Development Epoch

XSwarm organizes development into **epochs**—complete cycles that start with intensive planning and then run autonomously through multiple sprints. Think of it as front-loading all the thinking so AI teams can execute without constant hand-holding:

```
1. Expert Consultation → 40+ specialized AI agents analyze requirements
2. Interactive Prototyping → Live HTML demos, not static mockups
3. Intelligent Planning → 5-pass optimization to maximize parallelization
4. Automated Sprints → Multiple sprints run with parallel task execution
5. Complete Delivery → Code + Tests + Docs + Marketing assets
```

The key insight: one epoch contains many sprints, each sprint contains many parallel tasks. Human involvement ends after planning—the entire execution is autonomous.

## Key Innovations

### 🧠 Multi-Pass Planning

- **Pass 1**: Extract pure functions (60%+ reuse target)
- **Pass 2**: Sprint-specific utilities
- **Pass 3**: Atomic task decomposition
- **Pass 4**: Container environments
- **Pass 5**: Content integration

### 🚀 Parallel Execution

- Sandboxed task teams
- Zero coordination overhead
- Automatic integration
- No merge conflicts

### 📦 Complete Delivery

Every epoch ships:

- Production code
- Comprehensive tests
- Documentation
- Marketing assets
- Deployment config

## From Solo Developer to Team Commander

**Without XSwarm**: You craft prompts for a single AI assistant

- Write prompt → Wait for code → Test it → Fix issues → Repeat
- Every session starts fresh
- Integration is your problem
- Documentation comes later

**With XSwarm**: You command specialized AI teams

- Define what you need → Expert teams plan → Parallel execution → Complete delivery
- Shared context and functions
- Integration built-in
- Documentation generated automatically

## Installation

### Requirements

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g xswarm
```

### Direct Usage (Recommended)

```bash
npx xswarm
```

## Coming Soon

### Q1 2025
