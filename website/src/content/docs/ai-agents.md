## Working with Your Team

### Delegation Strategies

1. **Direct Request**: Ask a specific agent

   ```
   > Architect: Design a caching strategy for our API
   ```

2. **General Request**: Let xSwarm assign the right agents

   ```
   > Implement user authentication with JWT
   ```

3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Complex tasks automatically involve multiple agents
   ```
   > Build a complete blog feature with posts, comments, and moderation
   ```

### Agent Coordination

Agents automatically coordinate when needed:

- Architect designs, Developer implements
- Developer codes, Tester writes tests
- All agents follow consistent patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Architecture**: Let the Architect Agent design before implementation
2. **Iterate Frequently**: Make small requests and build incrementally
3. **Review Everything**: Always review AI-generated code before using
4. **Maintain Context**: Refer to previous work for consistency
