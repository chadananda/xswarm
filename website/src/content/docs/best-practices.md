# Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to maximize your effectiveness as an AI team leader with xSwarm.

## Communication Best Practices

### Be Specific and Clear

❌ **Vague Request:**

```
> Make the code better
```

✅ **Specific Request:**

```
> Refactor the user authentication module to use async/await and add proper error handling
```

### Provide Context

❌ **Without Context:**

```
> Add a cache
```

✅ **With Context:**

```
> Add Redis caching to the product API endpoints to reduce database load. Cache for 5 minutes.
```

### Break Down Complex Tasks

❌ **Overwhelming Request:**

```
> Build a complete e-commerce platform
```

✅ **Incremental Approach:**

```
> Design the architecture for an e-commerce platform
> Implement user authentication and registration
> Create product catalog with categories
> Add shopping cart functionality
> Implement checkout with Stripe
```

## Code Quality Practices

### Always Review Generated Code

1. **Understand the Logic**: Don't use code you don't understand
2. **Check for Security**: Review authentication, authorization, and data validation
3. **Verify Best Practices**: Ensure coding standards are met
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Run all tests before integration

### Maintain Consistency

```
> Follow the existing code style in this project. Use the same naming conventions and patterns.
```

### Request Tests

Always ask for tests with new features:

```
> Implement user profile updates with validation and include comprehensive unit tests
```

## Project Organization

### Start with Architecture

Before diving into code:

```
> Design the overall architecture for [your project]
> What design patterns should we use?
> How should we structure the database?
```

### Use Incremental Development

Build features incrementally:

1. Core functionality first
2. Add features one at a time
3. Test after each addition
4. Refactor as needed

### Document as You Go

```
> After implementing each feature, update the documentation
```

## Performance Optimization

### Profile Before Optimizing

```
> Analyze the performance bottlenecks in the current implementation
```

### Request Specific Optimizations

```
> Optimize the database queries in the user search functionality
> Add pagination to the products API endpoint
> Implement caching for frequently accessed data
```

## Security Best Practices

### Security-First Mindset

Always consider security:

```
> Implement user authentication with proper password hashing and JWT tokens
> Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
> Validate and sanitize all user inputs
```

### Regular Security Audits

```
> Review the authentication flow for security vulnerabilities
> Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities in the database queries
> Ensure all sensitive data is properly encrypted
```

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Handling

```
> Add proper error handling with meaningful error messages
> Implement global error handling middleware
> Log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive information
```

### User-Friendly Errors

```
> Create user-friendly error messages for common scenarios
> Add proper HTTP status codes to all API responses
```

## Testing Strategies

### Test-Driven Development

```
> Write tests for the user registration feature before implementing it
```

### Comprehensive Coverage

```
> Create unit tests for all utility functions
> Add integration tests for API endpoints
> Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows
```

### Edge Cases

```
> Include tests for edge cases and error scenarios
> Test with invalid inputs and boundary conditions
```

## Documentation Practices

### Self-Documenting Code

```
> Write clean, self-documenting code with meaningful variable and function names
```

### API Documentation

```
> Generate OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints
> Include request/response examples
> Document error responses
```

### Setup Instructions

```
> Create clear setup instructions for new developers
> Include all prerequisites and dependencies
> Add troubleshooting section
```

## Collaboration Patterns

### Version Control Integration

```
> Create meaningful commit messages for each feature
> Suggest a branching strategy for this project
```

### Code Review Preparation

```
> Prepare this code for review by adding comments explaining complex logic
> Create a pull request description summarizing the changes
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Over-Engineering

Don't request overly complex solutions for simple problems. Start simple and iterate.

### 2. Ignoring Context

Always consider your existing codebase and maintain consistency.

### 3. Skipping Tests

Never skip testing, even for "simple" features.

### 4. Blind Trust

Always review and understand generated code before using it.

### 5. Poor Error Handling

Don't ignore error cases - handle them properly.

## Productivity Tips

### 1. Use Templates

```
> Create a template for new API endpoints following our patterns
```

### 2. Batch Similar Tasks

```
> Create CRUD endpoints for users, products, and orders following the same pattern
```

### 3. Learn from Examples

```
> Show me an example of implementing authentication with refresh tokens
```

### 4. Ask for Explanations

```
> Explain why you chose this approach over alternatives
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Refactoring

```
> Review this module for potential improvements and technical debt
```

### Performance Monitoring

```
> Add performance monitoring to identify slow queries
```

### Stay Updated

```
> What are the latest best practices for [technology]?
> Are there newer, better alternatives to [current solution]?
```
