# Workflow Patterns

Learn proven patterns for orchestrating your AI team effectively. These workflows help you maximize productivity and quality.

## Feature Development Pattern

The most common workflow for adding new features:

### 1. Architecture First

```
> Design a user notification system that supports email, SMS, and in-app notifications
```

The Architect Agent will:

- Design the system architecture
- Recommend design patterns
- Identify required components
- Suggest technology choices

### 2. Incremental Implementation

```
> Implement the notification service base class with the architecture you designed
```

### 3. Parallel Development

```
> Create email, SMS, and in-app notification providers based on the base class
```

Multiple Developer Agents work simultaneously on different providers.

### 4. Testing & Documentation

```
> Write comprehensive tests for all notification providers and create API documentation
```

## Bug Fixing Pattern

Efficient approach to identifying and fixing issues:

### 1. Describe the Problem

```
> Users report that emails are not being sent when they reset their password
```

### 2. Investigation

The team will:

- Analyze the code flow
- Identify potential issues
- Suggest debugging steps

### 3. Fix Implementation

```
> Fix the email sending issue in the password reset flow
```

### 4. Verification

```
> Add tests to ensure password reset emails are sent correctly
```

## Refactoring Pattern

Improving existing code without changing functionality:

### 1. Analysis Request

```
> Analyze the user service for potential improvements and technical debt
```

### 2. Refactoring Plan

```
> Create a refactoring plan to improve the user service code quality
```

### 3. Incremental Refactoring

```
> Refactor the user authentication methods to use async/await
```

### 4. Testing

```
> Ensure all tests still pass after refactoring
```

## Greenfield Project Pattern

Starting a new project from scratch:

### 1. Project Setup

```
> Create a new Express.js API project with TypeScript, ESLint, and Jest
```

### 2. Core Architecture

```
> Design the architecture for a task management API with users, projects, and tasks
```

### 3. Database Design

```
> Create the database schema for the task management system
```

### 4. Implementation Phases

```
> Implement user authentication and registration
> Add project CRUD operations with authorization
> Create task management endpoints
> Add real-time updates using WebSockets
```

## Code Review Pattern

Getting AI assistance with code review:

### 1. Request Review

```
> Review this function for potential improvements: [paste code]
```

### 2. Security Audit

```
> Check this authentication code for security vulnerabilities
```

### 3. Performance Analysis

```
> Analyze this database query for performance issues
```

## Documentation Pattern

Creating comprehensive documentation:

### 1. API Documentation

```
> Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
```

### 2. Setup Guides

```
> Create a setup guide for new developers joining the project
```

### 3. Architecture Documentation

```
> Document the system architecture with diagrams and explanations
```

## Learning Pattern

Using xSwarm to learn new technologies:

### 1. Exploration

```
> Explain how GraphQL differs from REST and when to use each
```

### 2. Implementation

```
> Show me how to implement a simple GraphQL server with type safety
```

### 3. Best Practices

```
> What are the best practices for GraphQL schema design?
```

## Integration Pattern

Adding third-party services:

### 1. Research

```
> Compare Stripe, PayPal, and Square for payment processing
```

### 2. Implementation Plan

```
> Design the payment integration architecture using Stripe
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Integration

```
> Implement Stripe checkout for subscription payments
> Add webhook handling for payment events
> Create payment history and invoice generation
```

## Debugging Pattern

Systematic approach to fixing issues:

### 1. Error Analysis

```
> This error appears in production: [error message]. Help me understand what's happening
```

### 2. Reproduction

```
> Create a test case that reproduces this error
```

### 3. Solution

```
> Fix the error and add proper error handling
```

## Migration Pattern

Upgrading or migrating systems:

### 1. Analysis

```
> Analyze the effort required to migrate from Express to Fastify
```

### 2. Migration Plan

```
> Create a step-by-step migration plan with minimal downtime
```

### 3. Incremental Migration

```
> Migrate the authentication module to Fastify
```

## Best Practices for All Patterns

1. **Start Small**: Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
2. **Iterate Often**: Get feedback early and adjust
3. **Maintain Context**: Reference previous work for consistency
4. **Review Output**: Always review AI-generated code
5. **Test Everything**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
