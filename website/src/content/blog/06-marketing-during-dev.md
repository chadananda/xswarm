# Why AI Marketing Planning Should Happen During Development (Not After)

## Placeholder Content - Writing Instructions

### The Hook
The launch day scramble:
- Feature complete ✓
- Tests passing ✓
- Documentation... "coming soon"
- Marketing assets... *cricket sounds*
- Demo video... "can someone record their screen?"
- Blog post... "developers don't write marketing copy"

### Reality Check Section
- The traditional approach: build first, market later
- Why this fails: developers have moved on, context is lost
- The scramble for screenshots of features you built weeks ago
- Marketing creating content about features they don't understand
- The disconnect between technical reality and marketing promises

### The XSwarm Solution
- Marketing agents integrated into development teams
- Screenshot generation during integration testing
- Video capture from E2E test runs
- Blog posts generated from actual implementation details
- Social media content created from real feature capabilities
- Content calendar synchronized with sprint completion

### Real Examples
- Integration test → automatic screenshot → how-to article
- E2E test recording → feature demo video → social media clips
- Function documentation → developer tutorial → blog series
- Sprint completion → release notes → email campaign
- Show actual content generation pipeline

### The Content Pipeline:
```
Development Artifact → Marketing Asset → Distribution Channel
- Unit tests → Code examples → Developer docs
- Integration tests → Screenshots → Tutorials
- E2E tests → Demo videos → YouTube/Social
- API specs → Integration guides → Partner portal
- Error messages → Troubleshooting → Support docs
```

### Key Points to Cover:
- Why developers are the best source of authentic content
- How automated capture preserves context
- The compound effect of integrated content creation
- Building a library of assets during development
- Never launching without launch materials again

### Technical Implementation:
- Puppeteer integration for screenshot capture
- Video recording during E2E tests
- Automated content templates
- Marketing agent prompts and workflows
- Asset organization and tagging

### Tone Guidelines:
- Start with the pain of launch day scrambles
- Build understanding of why separation fails
- Excitement about integrated content creation
- Cyberpunk theme: "content synthesis during creation"
- End with vision of launches with full asset libraries

### Visual Elements to Include:
- Empty marketing folder (the pain)
- Automated content pipeline diagram
- Screenshot capture during testing
- Generated asset library
- Content calendar synchronized with sprints

### Length: 1500-2500 words
