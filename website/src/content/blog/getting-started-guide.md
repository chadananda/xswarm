## Understanding the XSwarm Architecture

Before diving into development, let's understand what XSwarm provides:

### Your AI Team

XSwarm comes with pre-configured AI agents, each specialized for specific tasks:

```yaml
agents:
  architect:
    role: "System design and architecture decisions"
    capabilities: ["Design patterns", "Scalability planning", "Tech stack selection"]
    
  developer:
    role: "Code implementation and optimization"
    capabilities: ["Code generation", "Refactoring", "Performance optimization"]
    
  tester:
    role: "Comprehensive testing strategies"
    capabilities: ["Unit tests", "Integration tests", "Edge case identification"]
    
  reviewer:
    role: "Code quality and standards enforcement"
    capabilities: ["Security scanning", "Best practices", "Performance analysis"]
    
  documenter:
    role: "Documentation and knowledge management"
    capabilities: ["API docs", "Architecture diagrams", "Usage examples"]
```

### The Command Center

Your primary interface with XSwarm is the command center:

```bash
# Launch the XSwarm command center
xswarm start

# You'll see:
üöÄ XSwarm Command Center Ready
üìä 5 AI agents online
üîÑ Workflow engine active
‚ö° Ready for commands...
```

## Your First Project: Building a Todo API

Let's build a complete REST API for a todo application. This example will demonstrate the power of AI coordination.

### Step 1: Project Planning

Start by describing what you want to build:

```bash
xswarm plan "Create a REST API for a todo application with CRUD operations, 
user authentication, and data persistence using PostgreSQL"
```

XSwarm's planning phase activates multiple agents:

```
ü§ñ Architect Agent: Designing system architecture...
üîç Research Agent: Analyzing best practices for todo APIs...
‚ö†Ô∏è  Risk Agent: Identifying potential challenges...

üìã Plan ready in 15 seconds!
```

You'll receive a comprehensive plan including:
- API endpoint specifications
- Database schema design
- Authentication strategy
- Technology recommendations
- Implementation timeline

### Step 2: Review and Approve

XSwarm presents the plan for your review:

```markdown
## Todo API Architecture Plan

### Technology Stack
- Runtime: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Authentication: JWT with refresh tokens
- Validation: Zod schemas
- Testing: Jest + Supertest

### API Endpoints
- POST   /auth/register
- POST   /auth/login
- POST   /auth/refresh
- GET    /todos
- POST   /todos
- GET    /todos/:id
- PUT    /todos/:id
- DELETE /todos/:id

### Database Schema
User:
  - id: UUID
  - email: string (unique)
  - password: string (hashed)
  - createdAt: timestamp

Todo:
  - id: UUID
  - userId: UUID (foreign key)
  - title: string
  - description: string?
  - completed: boolean
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - updatedAt: timestamp

[Continue? (Y/n)]
```

Type 'Y' to proceed with implementation.

### Step 3: Parallel Implementation

Watch as XSwarm coordinates multiple agents to build your API:

```bash
xswarm implement
```

The magic happens here‚Äîmultiple agents work in parallel:

```
üèóÔ∏è  Developer Agent: Implementing server and routes...
üóÑÔ∏è  Database Agent: Setting up PostgreSQL and migrations...
üîê Security Agent: Implementing authentication...
üß™ Test Agent: Writing comprehensive test suite...
üìù Doc Agent: Generating API documentation...

[Progress: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë] 85%
```

In about 3-5 minutes, you'll have:
- Complete Express server setup
- All CRUD endpoints implemented
- JWT authentication system
- Database models and migrations
- 95%+ test coverage
- Interactive API documentation

### Step 4: Review Generated Code

XSwarm doesn't just dump code on you‚Äîit provides a structured review:

```bash
xswarm review
```

You'll see:

```
üìä Code Review Summary
‚úÖ 8 endpoints implemented
‚úÖ 100% type safety with TypeScript
‚úÖ 96% test coverage (42 tests)
‚úÖ Security best practices applied
‚úÖ API documentation complete

üîç Key files to review:
1. src/server.ts - Main server setup
2. src/routes/auth.ts - Authentication endpoints
3. src/routes/todos.ts - Todo CRUD operations
4. src/middleware/auth.ts - JWT middleware
5. tests/api.test.ts - Comprehensive test suite

[Open in editor? (Y/n)]
```

### Step 5: Local Testing

Run your newly created API:

```bash
# Start the development server
xswarm run dev

# In another terminal, run tests
xswarm test

# Check the API documentation
open http://localhost:3000/api-docs
```

### Step 6: Making Changes

Need to modify something? XSwarm maintains context:

```bash
xswarm modify "Add a 'priority' field to todos with values: low, medium, high"
```

XSwarm will:
1. Update the database schema
2. Modify API endpoints
3. Update validation rules
4. Adjust tests
5. Update documentation

All while maintaining consistency across the codebase.

## Understanding XSwarm Workflows

Now that you've seen XSwarm in action, let's understand how workflows operate:

### Workflow Anatomy

Each XSwarm workflow consists of:

```yaml
workflow: "api-endpoint"
phases:
  - plan:
      agents: [architect, researcher]
      output: "Technical specification"
  
  - implement:
      agents: [developer, tester]
      parallel: true
      output: "Code and tests"
  
  - review:
      agents: [reviewer, security]
      output: "Quality report"
  
  - document:
      agents: [documenter]
      output: "API docs and examples"
```

### Custom Workflows

Create your own workflows for repetitive tasks:

```bash
# Create a custom workflow
xswarm workflow create "add-feature"

# Edit the workflow
xswarm workflow edit add-feature

# Use your workflow
xswarm run workflow add-feature "Add user profile management"
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Context Management

XSwarm maintains project context across sessions:

```bash
# Save current context
xswarm context save "v1-api-complete"

# List saved contexts
xswarm context list

# Switch contexts
xswarm context load "v1-api-complete"
```

### 2. Agent Customization

Tune agents for your specific needs:

```javascript
// .xswarm/agents/custom-reviewer.js
module.exports = {
  name: "custom-reviewer",
  role: "Enforce company-specific standards",
  rules: [
    "All functions must have JSDoc comments",
    "No console.log in production code",
    "Prefer functional programming patterns"
  ],
  severity: "error" // or "warning"
};
```

### 3. Workflow Pipelines

Chain workflows for complex operations:

```bash
xswarm pipeline create "full-feature" \
  --workflow "plan" \
  --workflow "implement" \
  --workflow "test" \
  --workflow "deploy"

# Run the pipeline
xswarm pipeline run full-feature "Add payment processing"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
Begin with simple tasks to understand XSwarm's capabilities:
- Generate a single endpoint
- Add a test suite to existing code
- Create documentation for a module

### 2. Review Everything
Always review AI-generated code:
- Check business logic accuracy
- Verify security implementations
- Ensure code style consistency

### 3. Maintain Context
Keep your project context updated:
```bash
# After major changes
xswarm context update

# Before starting new features
xswarm context sync
```

### 4. Customize Gradually
Start with default agents and workflows, then customize as you learn your patterns:
- Identify repetitive tasks
- Create specialized agents
- Build custom workflows

## Common Patterns

### The Quick Fix Pattern
For small changes:
```bash
xswarm fix "Users report that todo titles are being truncated"
```

### The Feature Addition Pattern
For new features:
```bash
xswarm feature "Add todo sharing functionality with email notifications"
```

### The Refactor Pattern
For code improvements:
```bash
xswarm refactor "Optimize database queries in todo retrieval"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding
```bash
# Check agent status
xswarm status

# Restart specific agent
xswarm restart agent developer
```

### Context Issues
```bash
# Reset context
xswarm context reset

# Rebuild from codebase
xswarm context rebuild
```

### Performance Problems
```bash
# Run diagnostics
xswarm diagnose

# Optimize agent allocation
xswarm optimize
```
