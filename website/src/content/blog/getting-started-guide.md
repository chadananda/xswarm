Welcome to XSwarm! You're about to transform from a solo developer into an AI team leader. This guide will show you how to launch XSwarm and orchestrate your first AI-powered development session.

## What is XSwarm?

XSwarm is an interactive CLI tool that opens a chat interface where you command a team of specialized AI agents. Think of it like Claude Code or GitHub Copilot Chat, but instead of talking to one AI, you're orchestrating an entire development team.

There are no CLI commands to memorize. You simply run `xswarm` and start chatting with your AI team.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- A terminal/command line interface
- A project directory to work in

## Installation

Getting XSwarm is simple:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g xswarm

# Or use directly with npx (no installation)
npx xswarm
```

## Your First Session

### Step 1: Launch XSwarm

Navigate to any project directory and start XSwarm:

```bash
cd my-project
xswarm
```

You'll see a welcome screen similar to this:

```

Welcome to XSwarm! I'm your AI team coordinator.

I have assembled your development team:
🏗️  Architect Agent - System design and technical decisions
💻  Developer Agents - Implementation and coding
🧪  Testing Agent - Comprehensive test coverage
📝  Documentation Agent - Clear, maintainable docs
🚀  DevOps Agent - Deployment and infrastructure
🔍  Review Agent - Code quality and best practices

Type your request or describe what you'd like to build:
>
```

### Step 2: Your First Request

Let's start with something simple. Type your first request:

```
> Create a REST API endpoint for user registration with email and password
```

XSwarm immediately begins orchestrating your AI team:

```
🤔 Understanding your request...

I'll help you create a user registration endpoint. Let me coordinate your AI team to build this properly.

🏗️ Architect: Planning the endpoint structure...
   - POST /api/auth/register
   - Request body: { email, password }
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Email validation
   - Duplicate email checking

💻 Developer: I'll implement this endpoint. Which framework are you using?
> Express

Great! I'll create an Express endpoint with proper security practices.

[Creating files...]

📄 Created: src/routes/auth.js
📄 Created: src/models/User.js
📄 Created: src/middleware/validation.js
📄 Created: tests/auth.test.js

🧪 Testing Agent: I've written comprehensive tests for:
   - Valid registration
   - Duplicate email handling
   - Invalid email format
   - Weak password rejection

Would you like to see the implementation?
>
```

### Step 3: Interactive Development

XSwarm is conversational. You can ask questions, request changes, or dive deeper:

```
> Show me the auth.js file
```

XSwarm responds:

```
📄 src/routes/auth.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const router = express.Router();
const User = require('../models/User');
const { validateRegistration } = require('../middleware/validation');

router.post('/register', validateRegistration, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { email, password } = req.body;
    
    // Check if user already exists
    const existingUser = await User.findOne({ email });
    if (existingUser) {
      return res.status(409).json({ 
        error: 'Email already registered' 
      });
    }
    
    // Hash password
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
    
    // Create user
    const user = await User.create({
      email,
      password: hashedPassword
    });
    
    // Return success (excluding password)
    res.status(201).json({
      id: user.id,
      email: user.email,
      createdAt: user.createdAt
    });
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Registration error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ 
      error: 'Registration failed' 
    });
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

💡 Developer: I've implemented secure password hashing, proper error handling, and duplicate email checking. The password is never returned in the response.

What would you like to do next?

```

### Step 4: Iterative Refinement

Continue the conversation to refine your code:

```
> Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
```

XSwarm's DevOps agent jumps in:

```
🚀 DevOps Agent: Good security thinking! I'll add rate limiting to protect against brute force attacks.

[Installing package...]
npm install express-rate-limit

[Updating code...]

📄 Updated: src/middleware/rateLimiting.js (created)
📄 Updated: src/routes/auth.js

Here's the rate limiter configuration:

```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const registrationLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5, // 5 registration attempts per window
  message: 'Too many registration attempts, please try again later',
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
});
```

🔒 Applied to your registration endpoint with:
- Maximum 5 registration attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- Clear error messages for users
- Standard rate limit headers for transparency

🧪 Testing Agent: I've also added tests for the rate limiting functionality.

## How XSwarm Works

Unlike traditional CLIs with fixed commands, XSwarm operates through natural conversation:

### No Commands to Memorize

Instead of:
```bash
xswarm create endpoint --type rest --method post --path /api/users
```

You simply say:
```
> Create a POST endpoint for creating users
```

### Context-Aware Assistance

XSwarm maintains context throughout your session:

```
> Now add email verification to the registration process

🏗️ Architect: Building on the registration endpoint, I'll design an email verification flow:
   1. Generate verification token on registration
   2. Send verification email
   3. Add GET /api/auth/verify/:token endpoint
   4. Update user model with 'verified' field

💻 Developer: Implementing email verification...
[Continue implementation...]
```

### Team Coordination

Watch as different agents collaborate:

```
> Build a complete todo list feature

🏗️ Architect: I'll design a full todo list feature with CRUD operations...

💻 Developer 1: I'll handle the database models and API endpoints...

💻 Developer 2: I'll create the frontend components simultaneously...

🧪 Testing Agent: I'll write tests as the code is developed...

📝 Documentation Agent: I'll document the API endpoints and usage...

[Multiple agents working in parallel...]
```

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Project

```
> Create a new Express API with TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and JWT authentication

[XSwarm orchestrates a complete project setup...]
```

### Adding Features

```
> Add a payment processing feature using Stripe

[XSwarm implements Stripe integration with your existing codebase...]
```

### Debugging

```
> Help me fix this error: "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined" in the user route

🔍 Review Agent: I see the issue. Let me analyze your code and provide a fix...
```

### Refactoring

```
> Refactor this function to be more maintainable and add proper error handling

💻 Developer: I'll refactor this following clean code principles...
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
The more specific your request, the better the results:

❌ Vague: "Make an API"
✅ Specific: "Create a REST API for a blog with posts, comments, and user authentication"

### 2. Iterative Development
Build features incrementally:

```
> Create a basic user model
> Now add authentication to the user model
> Add role-based permissions
> Implement password reset functionality
```

### 3. Ask for Explanations
Don't hesitate to ask your AI team to explain their decisions:

```
> Why did you choose bcrypt over argon2 for password hashing?

🏗️ Architect: Great question! Here's my reasoning...
```

### 4. Review Generated Code
Always review what your AI team creates:

```
> Show me all the files you just created
> Explain the security measures in the auth flow
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Agent Behavior

You can guide your AI team's approach:

```
> Use functional programming patterns for this feature

💻 Developer: I'll implement this using pure functions and composition...
```

### Technology Preferences

Specify your technology choices:

```
> Build this using Fastify instead of Express, with Prisma ORM

🏗️ Architect: Adjusting the architecture for Fastify and Prisma...
```

### Code Style

Request specific coding styles:

```
> Follow Airbnb style guide and add comprehensive JSDoc comments

💻 Developer: I'll ensure all code follows Airbnb conventions with detailed documentation...
```

## Tips for Success

### Start Small
Begin with simple requests to understand how XSwarm responds:
- "Create a hello world endpoint"
- "Add a simple middleware for logging"
- "Write tests for this function"

### Build Incrementally
Complex applications are built one feature at a time:
1. Start with core models
2. Add basic CRUD operations
3. Layer in authentication
4. Add advanced features

### Leverage the Team
Different agents excel at different tasks:
- Ask the Architect for system design decisions
- Have Developers implement features
- Let the Testing Agent ensure quality
- Use DevOps for deployment concerns

### Maintain Context
XSwarm remembers your conversation, so build on previous requests:
```
> Remember the user model we created? Add social login to it
```

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the basics:

1. **Experiment**: Try building different types of features
2. **Explore**: Ask your AI team about best practices
3. **Create**: Build something real with your new AI team
4. **Share**: Join the XSwarm community to share experiences

## Troubleshooting

### XSwarm Not Responding
If XSwarm seems stuck:
- Press Ctrl+C to interrupt
- Restart with `xswarm`
- Your conversation context is maintained

### Unexpected Output
If the AI team misunderstands:
- Rephrase your request
- Provide more context
- Give specific examples

### Need Help?
Just ask your AI team:
```
> How do I implement OAuth2 authentication?
> What's the best way to structure this project?
> Can you explain this error message?
```
