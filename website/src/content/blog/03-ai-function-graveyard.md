# AI Function Graveyard: Why Your Multi-Pass Planning Could Save Your Codebase

## Placeholder Content - Writing Instructions

### The Hook
Start with the brutal truth:
- Show 5 different AI-generated email validation functions from one project
- Each slightly different, all basically the same
- The copy-paste museum of AI-generated utilities
- "Your codebase is a graveyard of AI's greatest hits"

### Reality Check Section
- Why AI recreates common functions (no memory between sessions)
- The hidden cost: tokens, time, technical debt
- Real statistics: average duplication rates in AI-generated code
- The maintenance nightmare of 47 similar-but-different functions
- War story: debugging which validation function was actually being used

### The XSwarm Solution
- Multi-pass planning philosophy
- Pass 1: Extract ALL pure functions first
- Pass 2: Build sprint-specific utilities
- Pass 3: Create comprehensive function registry
- How AI teams share and reuse functions
- The 60%+ reuse rate target

### Real Examples
- Before: 15 different date formatting functions
- After: 1 date utility module, 15 reuse instances
- Code showing function extraction process
- Registry search and reuse workflow
- Token savings calculation (it's massive)

### Technical Deep Dive:
- Function dependency graphs
- Complexity scoring algorithms
- Reusability metrics
- Registry schema and search
- Automated documentation generation

### Key Points to Cover:
- Why pure functions are the foundation
- The compound effect of function reuse
- How registries become team memory
- Breaking the regeneration cycle
- Building on foundations, not starting fresh

### Tone Guidelines:
- Dark humor about the "function graveyard"
- Recognition that we've all been there
- Excitement about systematic solutions
- Cyberpunk metaphor: "digital archaeology" of function extraction
- Call to action: "Stop feeding the graveyard"

### Visual Elements to Include:
- The graveyard: visualization of duplicate functions
- Function dependency graph
- Registry interface mockup
- Reuse rate metrics dashboard
- Before/after codebase visualization

### Length: 1500-2500 words
