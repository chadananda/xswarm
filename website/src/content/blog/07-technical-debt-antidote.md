# Multi-Pass AI Planning: The Antidote to Technical Debt Poisoning

## Placeholder Content - Writing Instructions

### The Hook
The technical debt speedrun:
- Day 1: "AI wrote this feature in 30 minutes!"
- Day 30: "Why are there 5 different auth implementations?"
- Day 90: "We need to refactor everything the AI touched"
- Day 180: "Let's just rewrite it from scratch"
- The poison: AI doesn't know your patterns, so it invents new ones

### Reality Check Section
- Why AI creates MORE technical debt than juniors
- The pattern proliferation problem
- AI's tendency to solve problems locally, not globally
- Real examples of AI-induced architectural disasters
- The compound interest of AI technical debt

### The XSwarm Solution
- 5-pass planning process explained:
  - Pass 1: Pure function extraction
  - Pass 2: Sprint-specific utilities
  - Pass 3: Task decomposition
  - Pass 4: Container design
  - Pass 5: Content integration
- How each pass builds on existing architecture
- Pattern recognition and enforcement
- Architectural consistency across AI teams

### Real Examples
- Before: 5 different error handling patterns
- After: 1 consistent pattern used everywhere
- Code showing planning passes in action
- Dependency graphs ensuring consistency
- Architecture documentation that AI actually follows

### The Planning Deep Dive:
- How multi-pass planning works
- Pattern extraction from existing code
- Constraint definition for AI teams
- Architectural guardrails
- Quality gates that enforce patterns

### Key Points to Cover:
- Why planning prevents debt (not just documents it)
- The economics of prevention vs cleanup
- How constraints enable creativity
- Building on foundations vs creating new ones
- The compound effect of architectural consistency

### Technical Details:
- Planning document schemas
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Constraint enforcement mechanisms
- Integration validation
- Architectural fitness functions

### Tone Guidelines:
- Start with the horror of AI technical debt
- Build understanding of root causes
- Present planning as prevention, not bureaucracy
- Cyberpunk metaphor: "architectural immunization"
- End with clean, sustainable AI development

### Visual Elements to Include:
- Technical debt growth curves
- 5-pass planning flowchart
- Before/after architecture diagrams
- Pattern consistency metrics
- Code quality dashboards

### Length: 1500-2500 words
