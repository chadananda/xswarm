# The 40 AI Agents Nobody Told You About (And Why You Need Them All)

## Placeholder Content - Writing Instructions

### The Hook
The agents you didn't know you needed:
- Everyone talks about AI developers
- But who's writing your tests? (QA Engineer Agent)
- Who's checking for vulnerabilities? (Security Tester Agent)
- Who's creating your demo videos? (Video Content Creator Agent)
- Who's optimizing your SEO? (SEO Specialist Agent)
- Your AI coding assistant is lonely and overwhelmed

### Reality Check Section
- Current focus: AI that codes
- Reality: Development is 20% coding, 80% everything else
- The missing pieces in AI development
- Why specialized agents beat generalists
- Examples of disasters from missing specializations
